    <h2>Logback Project</h2>

    <p>Logback is intended as a successor to the popular log4j
        project, <a href="reasonsToSwitch.html">picking up where log4j 1.x
            leaves off</a>. </p>

    <p>Logback's architecture is quite generic so as to apply
        under different circumstances. At present time, logback is divided
        into three modules, logback-core, logback-classic and
        logback-access.
    </p>

    <p>The logback-core module lays the groundwork for the other two
        modules. The logback-classic module can be assimilated to a
        significantly improved version of log4j 1.x. Moreover,
        logback-classic natively implements the <a
                href="http://www.slf4j.org">SLF4J API</a> so that you can readily
        switch back and forth between logback and other logging frameworks
        such as log4j 1.x or java.util.logging (JUL).
    </p>

    <p>The logback-access module integrates with Servlet containers,
        such as Tomcat and Jetty, to provide HTTP-access log
        functionality. Note that you could easily build your own module
        on top of logback-core.
    </p>
