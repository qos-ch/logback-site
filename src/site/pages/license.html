    <h2>Logback License</h2>

    <p>As of release 0.9.18, logback source code and binaries are
        dual-licensed under the EPL v1.0 and the LGPL 2.1, or more
        formally:</p>

    <div class="license">
        <p>Logback: the reliable, generic, fast and flexible logging framework.</p>
        <p>Copyright (C) 1999-2022, QOS.ch. All rights reserved.</p>


        <p>This program and the accompanying materials are dual-licensed under
either the terms of the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html">Eclipse Public License v1.0</a> as published by
            the Eclipse Foundation</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;or (per the licensee's choosing)</p>

    <!-- =========================================== -->

    <p>The EPL/LGPL dual-license serves several purposes. The LGPL
        license ensures <em>continuity</em> in terms of licensing of the
        logback project. Prior to version 0.9.18, logback was licensed
        (exclusively) under the LGPL v2.1. Moreover, since the EPL is
        deemed <a
                href="http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/index_htm">incompatible</a>
        by the Free Software Foundation, the LGPL will allow various
        licensees, in particular software distributors who may be already
        bound by the terms of the GPL or the LGPL, to distribute our
        software.
    </p>

    <p>On the other hand, the EPL license will placate organizations
        which refuse certain restrictions imposed by the LGPL.
    </p>

    <p>Please note that logback-classic is intended to be used behind
        the SLF4J API, which is licensed under the <a
                href="http://www.slf4j.org/license.html">MIT license</a>.
    </p>

    <p>If you wish to make a significant contribution to the logback
        project, you are invited to file a <a href="cla.txt">Contributor
            License Agreement</a>. The purpose of this agreement is to
        formalize the terms of your contribution and to protect the
        project in case of litigation.
    </p>

    <p>Upon request, we may exempt open-source projects from LGPL and
        EPL's reciprocity clauses so that the said projects can develop
        logback extensions under the license of their choice. Exemptions
        are granted on a case by case basis.</p>
