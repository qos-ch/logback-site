        <h2>Project Mailing Lists</h2>

        <p>A mailing list is an electronic discussion forum that
        anyone can subscribe to. When someone sends an email message
        to the mailing list, a copy of that message is broadcast to
        everyone who is subscribed to that mailing list.
        </p>     
        
        <p>The "announce" list is reserved for announcing releases. As
        such, the traffic on this list is guaranteed to be very low.</p>
        
        <p>The logback-dev is the list for the developpers of
        logback. It is a good forum for asking questions about how
        logback works, and how it can be used. Logback developers are
        usually subscribed to this list and may offer support.
        </p>
